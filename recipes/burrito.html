<h2>Description</h3>
    <p>I usually keep burritos stocked in my freezer just for this frozen burrito casserole recipe. It's so quick and easy and tastes delicious. Can be served with tortilla chips and a salad. Or double the sauce, and serve over rice.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>6 frozen bean and cheese burritos</li>
        <li>1 (10.5 ounce) can condensed cream of chicken or cream of mushroom soup</li>
        <li>½ cup sour cream</li>
        <li>1 (4 ounce) can diced green chile peppers, drained</li>
        <li>1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>1 medium tomato, chopped (Optional)</li>
        <li>1 avocado - peeled, pitted and sliced (Optional)</li>
        <li>1 (2.25 ounce) can sliced black olives, drained (Optional)</li>
        <li>½ cup salsa (Optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Place burritos in a row across the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. In a medium bowl, stir together condensed soup, sour cream, and chile peppers. Spread evenly over the top of the burritos. Sprinkle with shredded cheese. </li>
        <li>Bake for 25 to 30 minutes in the preheated oven, until cheese is slightly browned and burritos are heated through. Serve with tomato, avocado, olives, and salsa.</li>
